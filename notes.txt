to run the servers , use the following commands . 

for i in range(1,5):
    npm run start:s{i}


for load balancer use : npm run start:lb

to run the test files use : npx ts-node test-ddos.ts



NOTES :

1. We are using Round-robin system, we can change if we get a new algo or a better algo to work on , but that's not out main objective for now as we need to implement the servers to safe attacks and not find an effecient algo for load balancer , i mean we can do that but if time permits.

2. Rate Limiter .. we use to configure the rate's or amount of requests an ip can send.
