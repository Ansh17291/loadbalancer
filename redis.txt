to see in redis

1. run redis - redis-server
2. redis-cli

-- custom dictionary
3. GET ddos-log:::1
"{\"ip\":\"::1\",\"timestamp\":\"2025-08-07T02:40:47.638Z\"}"

-- redlimiter dictionary
4. GET ddos:::1
"30" 

how it works:

Connects to Redis and sets up a rate limiter to allow limited requests per IP.
Creates multiple worker processes based on CPU cores (using clustering).
Each worker listens for incoming requests.
Checks if the IP has exceeded its request limit using Redis.
If allowed, forwards the request to one of the backend servers using round-robin.
